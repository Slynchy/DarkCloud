Dark Cloud tools
=========

LightCloud and WhiteCloud are tools to unpack and repack files from Dark Cloud™ and Dark Cloud™ 2 (Dark Chronicles™ in Europe) games. 

WhiteCloud unpacks .DAT files, using an .HD2 or an .HD3 file. The HD3 files are exclusive to Dark Chronicles™. The files are exported to a directory of the same name as the .HDx file.

LightCloud repacks the unpacked files using an .HDx file. This means that if you add new files into the unpacking directory, they will be not added into the new .DAT file. 

TM2Extract scans a file for TIM2 files (.tm2) and extracts them.

LightCloud and WhiteCloud was written by Luciano Ciccariello (Xeeynamo), and TM2 Extract was written by Sam Lynch. Their source code are downloadable at http://github.com/Xeeynamo/DarkCloud
